# sd-danbooru-tags-upsampler

Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅØ[„Åì„Å°„Çâ](./README-ja.md)„Å∏

An extension for Stable Diffusion Web UI that upsamples prompts by generating or completing danbooru tags using lightweight LLM.

It's useful for people who don't want think about long prompt or want to see **diverse**, **natural** and **high quality** images without any thinking.

## Upsates

- 2024/2/29: v0.2.0 has been released. New features; generation options, variety level and range ban tags.
- 2024/2/25: v0.1.1 has been released. Handling of seeds, escaping processing of brackets and many bugs are fixed.
- 2024/2/23: First version v0.1.0 has been released.

## Usage

<img src="./images/screenshot-1.jpg" width="540px" alt="Scrennshot of this extension" />

Open the `Danbooru Tags Upsampler` accordion and check the `Enabled` checkbox to enable this extension.

Explanation of parameters:

| Parameter name | Description | Example value |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| **Total tag length** | This parameter can specify the amount of **total tags after completing the positive prompt**. Not the amount of completing tags. `very short` means "less than 10 tags", `short` means "less than 20 tags", `long` means "less than 40 tags" and `very long` is more than that. | `long` is recommended |
| **Ban tags** | All tags in this field will never appear in completion tags. It's useful when you don't want to contain some specific tags. Using `*` maches to any character. (e.g. `* background` matches to `simple background`, `white background`, ...) | `official alternate costume, english text, * background, ...` |
| **Seed for upsampling tags** | If this number and the positive prompt are fixed, the completion tags are also fixed. `-1` means "generates tags using random seed every time" | If you want to generate images with different final prompts every time, set to `-1`. |
| **Upsampling timing** | When to upsample, before or after other prompt processing (e.g. sd-dynamic-prompts or webui's styles feature) are applied.  | `After applying other prompt processings` |
| **Variety level** | These parameters are presets of the `Generation config`. This can change the variety of upsampled tags. | `varied` |
| **Generation config** | LLM parameters of generating tags. It's recommended not to touch if you are not familiar with language model's generation parameters, and use `Variety level` option instead. ||

Generation settings:

- Model: [AnimagineXL 3.0](https://huggingface.co/cagliostrolab/animagine-xl-3.0)
- Negative prompt (same as the recommended settings of animaginexl 3.0):

```
nsfw, lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name
```

Upsampling settings:

- Total tag length: `long`
- Ban tags: none
- Seed: `-1`
- When to perform the process: `Before applying styles`

### Variation levels

(The seeds are not the same.)

        <td width="10%">Input prompt</td>

        <td><img src="./images/variation-very_varied-3.jpg" alt="Variation sample image 3; very varied" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

`Very unvaried` and `Unvaried` mean less variety, but at the same time, faithful to the input prompt and generate relatively acceptable tags. Also, `Very varied` and `Varied` mean more variety, but tend to ignore the input prompt and often generate weird tags. 

## Access to the model weights

This extension uses the following model:

- `p1atdev/dart-v1-sft`: [ü§ó HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/p1atdev/dart-v1-sft)

## Want to use without sd webui?

A demo on ü§ó Space is avaiable, so you can try upsampling tags without installing this extension:

Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/p1atdev/danbooru-tags-transformer

## How to change default values?

Open `[webui's root directory]/ui-config.json`, then find parameters staring with `customscript/dart_upsampler.py/` and edit them.

If you feel that the default values are broken, you can delete parameters staring with `customscript/dart_upsampler.py/txt2img/` to reset the default values.
